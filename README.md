**NOAA SPC RSS WATCHER**

I plan to create a watcher for NOAA SPC RSS feed, in order to keep an eye on severe weather activity in the CLI.

For now everything will be in this repo, later i will extract the fetch/parser as a library and then here will contain only the CLI app. Further, i plan to build a WebApp (also in Rust, of course) to use the lib to display nicely the feed!
